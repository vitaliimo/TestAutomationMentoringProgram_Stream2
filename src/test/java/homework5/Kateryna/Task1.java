He is at one point an inmate at \"Larkhill Resettlement Camp\"â€” one of many concentration camps where black people, Jews, leftists, beatniks, homosexuals and Ethnic Irish are exterminated by Norsefire, a fascist dictatorship that rules Britain. While there, he is part of a group of prisoners who are subjected to horrific medical experimentation, conducted by Dr. Delia Surridge. Lewis Prothero is the camp's commandant, while Father Anthony Lilliman, a q1 vicar, is at the camp to lend \"spiritual support\". All prisoners who are part of the experiment die, with the sole exception of \"the man in room five\" (\"V\" in Roman numerals). As a result of the experiments, the man develops Olympic-level physical abilities and an incredibly expanded intellect. During that time, the man had some level of communication with Valerie Page, a former actress imprisoned for being a lesbian, kept in \"room four\", who wrote her autobiography on toilet paper and then pushed it through a hole in the wall";
